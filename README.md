# SmarterTrack-Danish

Danish U.I. translation for  [SmarterTrack](https://www.smartertools.com/smartertrack).

Note: This is work in progress - the translation is **NOT COMPLETE** yet. Items not yet translated appear in English.

My primary goal is to translate the end-user facing parts - not necessarily the management interface. However, since both sides share the same translation file, a lot of the management interface has already been translated too.

I have also created and released a Windows desktop tool "SmarterTrackTranslator" to ease the translation work. See https://github.com/jesperhoy/SmarterTrackTranslator

The "da.translate.xml" file contains only the items that have been translated to far.

The "da.xml" file is a combined file (Danish/English) for use with SmarterTrack.

The "key-terms.md" file lists translations of key terms which are used again and again in the translation.

You might want to use the [SmarterTrackTranslator](https://github.com/jesperhoy/SmarterTrackTranslator) tool to work with the translation files.
